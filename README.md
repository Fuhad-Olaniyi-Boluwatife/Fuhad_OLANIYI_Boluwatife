## About Me

I’m a young, enthusiastic professional with a B.Sc. in Physics and a growing passion for data analysis.

Currently building a career in data analytics, I bring hands-on experience with tools such as Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python (intermediate level). I’m proficient in data cleaning, processing, visualization, and analysis, and I enjoy using these skills to uncover trends, measure performance, and drive strategic actions.
I’m committed to continuous learning and professional growth, and I’m excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals while making a meaningful impact in the tech and analytics space.
